Wow, you're now at La Creu Alta station! Even though you can't see much from the underground station, let me tell you a secret about the area above us.

Imagine you're standing on the surface, and you look around. You'd see a big, busy street called Carrer de la Creu Alta. It's a very important road that connects different parts of the city. But here's the cool part: this area has been a crossing point for centuries! In the old days, people would travel from the Pyrenees Mountains to the Mediterranean Sea, and they'd pass through this exact spot.

Did you know that the name "La Creu Alta" means "The High Cross" in Catalan? It's because, a long, long time ago, there was a big cross standing tall on this very spot. It was a symbol of protection and guidance for travelers. Even though the cross is not there anymore, the name remains as a reminder of the area's rich history.

As you exit the station with your family, you'll be close to the Serra de Collserola Natural Park. It's a beautiful green area with trees, hills, and amazing views of Barcelona. Who knows, maybe you'll get to explore it with your family during your visit!

Now, get ready to start your adventure in Barcelona with your family!
