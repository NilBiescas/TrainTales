Woohoo! You're arriving at Sant Quirze station! Look out the window and you'll see a lot of houses and buildings, right? This area is called Sant Quirze del Vallès, and it's a town just outside of Barcelona.

Hey, do you see that big park on your left? That's the Parc de la Vall del Tenes! It's a huge green space where people come to play, walk their dogs, or have picnics. If you look closely, you might even spot a stream running through the park. That's the Tenes River, which flows all the way from the mountains to the Mediterranean Sea!

Sant Quirze del Vallès has a rich history, dating back to the Roman times! Can you believe that? The Romans built a road that went right through this area, and it was an important route for traders and travelers. Later, in the Middle Ages, this town became a stopping point for pilgrims on their way to Santiago de Compostela, a famous pilgrimage site in Spain.

As you look around, you might notice that the buildings here are a mix of old and new. That's because Sant Quirze has been growing and changing over the years. The old town has narrow streets and historic buildings, while the newer areas have modern houses and apartments.

Are you excited to explore this new town with your family? Maybe you can even visit the ancient Roman road or the historic town center!
