OH BOY! You must be SO excited to be in Barcelona!

Hey, I know you're looking out the window, but since we're underground, there's not much to see from down here. BUT, let me tell you a SECRET about the area above us!

Sarrià is a really old neighborhood in Barcelona, and it's got a special charm! Imagine walking through the streets above us, surrounded by beautiful trees, old buildings, and fancy shops. You might stumble upon the famous Sarrià Market, where locals buy yummy food and treats.

Did you know that Sarrià used to be a separate town, way back in the 1800s? It was a tiny village surrounded by farms and fields. Over time, the city of Barcelona grew bigger and bigger, and eventually, Sarrià became a part of it!

Now, imagine you're walking up the hill from the station, and you reach the top. Wow! You'll see the most amazing view of the city! You can even see the Mediterranean Sea sparkling in the distance.

So, even though you can't see much from the train window, Sarrià has lots of surprises waiting for you and your family. Are you ready to explore this awesome neighborhood?
