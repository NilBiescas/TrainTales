WOW, you must be so excited to arrive at Peu del Funicular station! As you look out the window, you'll see that we're in a tunnel, but don't worry, I've got a cool story to tell you about what's just outside!

Right above us, there's a super cool funicular railway that takes people up a steep hill to the top of a mountain called Tibidabo. Can you imagine riding a special train that goes up, up, up a steep hill? It's like a big coaster, but instead of going down, it takes you to the top of the mountain!

Did you know that Tibidabo is the tallest hill in Barcelona? From the top, you can see the entire city and even the sea! On a clear day, you can see the Pyrenees mountains, which are really, really far away!

But that's not all! At the top of Tibidabo, there's an amazing amusement park called Tibidabo Amusement Park. It's one of the oldest in the world! Imagine riding old-fashioned roller coasters and enjoying yummy treats while looking out at the breathtaking view!

When you get out of the station, take a look around, and you might see the funicular train going up the hill. Who knows, maybe you'll even get to ride it later!

So, what do you think? Are you ready to explore Tibidabo and see the amazing view from the top?
