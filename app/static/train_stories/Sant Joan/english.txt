Wow, you're arriving at Sant Joan station! Look out the window and you'll see a big, modern building with a lot of people moving around. That's the station itself! But if you look further, you might see some really cool things.

Do you see those tall buildings with funny shapes and colorful roofs? Those are some of the famous buildings designed by Antoni Gaudí, a very famous architect from Barcelona. He loved to create buildings that looked like they came from a fantasy world! One of those buildings, the Sagrada Família, is actually a giant church that's been under construction for over 130 years!

As you look around, you might see some trees and a big highway. That highway is called the Ronda de Dalt, and it's one of the biggest roads in Barcelona. But did you know that before it was a highway, it was a river? Yeah, it's true! The river was diverted underground, and now it's a road where cars can drive.

You know what's really cool about Sant Joan station? It's been around since 1975, but it was renovated in 2005 to make it bigger and more modern. So, the building you see today is a mix of old and new!

As you get off the train, take a deep breath and get ready to explore this amazing city with your family! What do you think you'll discover first in Barcelona?
