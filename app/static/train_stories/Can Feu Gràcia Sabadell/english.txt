Hey there, young adventurer! As your train pulls into Can Feu Gràcia Sabadell station, I've got a fascinating tale to share with you! 

You know how we're underground right now? Well, above us lies a super cool neighborhood called Gràcia, which is part of Barcelona. This area has been around for centuries! Can you believe it?

Back in the 17th century, Gràcia was a tiny village with just a few houses, farms, and a lovely church. As time passed, more people started moving in, and the village grew into a bustling neighborhood. Today, Gràcia is famous for its trendy vibe, vibrant streets, and magnificent festivals, especially during La Festa Major de Gràcia in August!

Imagine walking through narrow streets lined with colorful buildings, shops, and cafes. You'd hear the sound of castanets, smell delicious food, and feel the energy of a lively neighborhood. That's Gràcia for you!

The area is also home to Park Güell, one of Barcelona's most famous attractions. It's a magical place designed by Antoni Gaudí, a genius architect who loved nature and wanted to create a park that blended seamlessly with the surrounding hills. You'll get to see it when you exit the station and explore the area!

Now, as we're underground, I won't ask you to look out the window, but I hope this story has sparked your curiosity about the amazing world above us! Get ready to explore this fantastic neighborhood with your family!
