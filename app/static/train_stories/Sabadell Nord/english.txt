Wow, you're at Sabadell Nord station! Okay, so you might not be able to see much from the train window since the station is underground, but let me tell you some cool stuff about the area above us.

Sabadell is a city that's part of the Barcelona metropolitan area, and it's known for its rich history and textile production. In fact, Sabadell used to be a major center for making fabric, especially wool and cotton. The city was home to many factories and mills, which is why it was called the "Catalan Manchester" (like the famous city in England that was also a big textile producer!).

Imagine you're walking around the city above us. You'd see old industrial buildings, some of which have been converted into museums, libraries, and cultural centers. You might even spot the Torre de l'Aigua, a beautiful old water tower that's now a symbol of Sabadell.

If you look closely at the station's signs and maps, you might notice that Sabadell is divided into two parts: Sabadell Nord (North) and Sabadell Sud (South). That's because the city grew quite a bit over time, and the railway line that you're on right now was built to connect these two parts.

As you depart the station with your family, you might get to explore some of Sabadell's hidden gems, like the beautiful Parc de Catalunya or the historic center with its charming streets and squares. Who knows, maybe you'll even discover some of the city's delicious traditional sweets, like the famous xuixo pastry!
