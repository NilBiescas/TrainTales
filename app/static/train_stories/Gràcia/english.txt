Wow! You're arriving at Gràcia station! Unfortunately, since we're underground, you can't see much from the window, but I can tell you a secret about the neighborhood above us!

You're now in the heart of the Gràcia neighborhood, which used to be a separate town a long, long time ago! Can you believe it? Back in the 19th century, Gràcia was a small village with its own town hall, church, and even a train station (not this one, though!). It was a very lively place, full of farmers, artisans, and shopkeepers.

As the city of Barcelona grew, Gràcia became a part of it, but it still kept its own special charm. The neighborhood above us is now famous for its narrow streets, colorful buildings, and lively squares. If you could look up, you'd see lots of tiny shops, cafes, and restaurants, as well as the famous Park Güell, another one of Antoni Gaudí's amazing creations!

Gràcia is also known for its festive spirit. Every August, the neighborhood celebrates its famous Festa Major de Gràcia, with decorated streets, live music, and lots of fun activities. Imagine a giant party that takes over the whole neighborhood!

Even though you can't see it from the train window, just imagine all the excitement waiting for you above ground. Who knows, maybe you'll get to explore Gràcia with your family and discover its secrets?
