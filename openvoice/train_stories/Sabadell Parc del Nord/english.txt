Hi there! Well, since you're looking out the window, you might not be able to see much because the station is underground, but let me tell you a secret! 

Imagine you're standing on the surface, right above where the train is stopped. You'd see a huge park called Parc del Nord, which is why the station is named Sabadell Parc del Nord. This park is like a big green lung in the heart of Sabadell, and it's where people love to go for walks, play games, or have picnics.

A long, long time ago, this area was actually used for farming and had many orchards and gardens. Over time, the city grew, and the park was created to provide a peaceful space for the people of Sabadell. Today, it's a favorite spot for both locals and visitors like you!

As you continue your journey with your family, you might get to explore more of Sabadell's hidden treasures. Who knows, maybe you'll even visit the park and see the beautiful flowers, trees, and birds that call it home!
