Did you know that Volpelleres is a special neighborhood in Barcelona because it's where the city meets the mountains? It's a really popular place for people who love nature and the outdoors. In fact, the name "Volpelleres" comes from the Catalan words for "wolf's lair," because a long time ago, there were wolves living in these mountains!

As your train is stopping at the station, take a peek at the buildings around you. You might see some really cool street art and murals on the walls. That's because Barcelona is a city that loves art and creativity! Even the buildings themselves are often decorated with intricate designs and colors, which makes the city feel really vibrant and fun.
