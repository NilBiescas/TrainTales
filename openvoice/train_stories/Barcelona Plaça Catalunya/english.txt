Above us, Plaça Catalunya is one of the biggest and most famous squares in Barcelona. It's like a huge playground where people meet, take pictures, and have fun. Imagine a giant space filled with beautiful fountains, statues, and loads of street performers and musicians. You might even spot some living statues – they're people dressed up as robots or superheroes, and they stay completely still until you give them some money!

Did you know that Plaça Catalunya has been an important spot in Barcelona for centuries? Back in the 19th century, it was just a big empty field where people would take their horses and carriages for a walk. Over time, it became a popular meeting point, and now it's a symbol of the city.

As we speak, your train is stopping right beneath the square. If you could look up, you'd see the hustle and bustle of the city – people rushing to work, tourists taking selfies, and street vendors selling all sorts of cool things.
