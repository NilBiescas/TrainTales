Hey there, young explorer! As we pull into La Bonanova station, I've got a fascinating story to share with you!

Right now, we're underground, so you can't see much outside the window. But let me tell you about the exciting world above us! La Bonanova is a neighborhood in the Sarrià-Sant Gervasi district, and it's a treasure trove of history and secrets!

Did you know that "Bonanova" means "good news" in Catalan? Legend has it that a long, long time ago, a farmer found a beautiful statue of the Virgin Mary in a nearby well. It was a miracle, and the farmer thought it was "good news"! From then on, the area was named La Bonanova in honor of that special discovery.

Imagine walking through the streets above us, surrounded by beautiful parks, old mansions, and modern buildings. You might stumble upon the famous Turó Park, where people have picnics and play sports. Or, you could explore the historic streets, discovering hidden squares and charming cafes.

La Bonanova is also home to some of Barcelona's most important hospitals and medical centers. In the past, this area was a retreat for wealthy people who wanted to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. They built grand villas and estates, many of which still stand today!

As we continue our journey, keep your imagination running wild! Who knows what adventures await you and your family in this enchanting city?
