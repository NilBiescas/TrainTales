Woohoo! You're now at Sant Gervasi station! Unfortunately, since we're underground, you can't see much from the window, but I can tell you a secret about the neighborhood above us!

You're now in one of the most elegant and historic neighborhoods in Barcelona! The area above us is called Sarrià-Sant Gervasi, and it's famous for its beautiful modernist architecture, fancy shops, and delicious restaurants. If you could look up, you'd see some of the most stunning buildings in Barcelona, like the Casa Fuster, a beautiful modernist house that's now a luxury hotel!

But what's really cool is that this neighborhood used to be home to wealthy families in the 19th century. They built gorgeous mansions and estates in the area, which became known as the "Jardin de la Ciudad" (Garden of the City). Imagine a place with huge gardens, fountains, and beautiful sculptures – like a fairy tale!

The neighborhood is also famous for its connection to the tram, which used to run from the city center to the nearby hills. In fact, the station we're in right now was originally a tram stop! Can you imagine riding a historic tram through the streets of Barcelona?

Even though you can't see it from the window, I hope this gives you a sense of the amazing history and beauty above us! Who knows, maybe you'll get to explore this neighborhood with your family and discover its secrets?
