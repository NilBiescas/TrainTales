Oh boy, you're going to love this! Unfortunately, since we're underground, you can't see much from the window, but let me tell you an amazing secret about the neighborhood above us.

You're now in the Eixample district, which is a very special part of Barcelona. "Eixample" means "extension" in Catalan, because a long time ago, this area was built to extend the city and make it bigger. And guess what? The whole neighborhood was designed by a brilliant architect named Ildefons Cerdà, who wanted to make it easy for people to move around and have plenty of green spaces.

One of the coolest things about this neighborhood is the way the streets are designed. If you could look up, you'd see that the streets are like a big grid, with straight lines and right angles. It's like a big chessboard! This was a super innovative idea back in the 19th century, and it makes it really easy to navigate the city.

But here's the best part: the Eixample district is home to some of the most famous modernist buildings in Barcelona, like Casa Milà and Casa Batlló, designed by Antoni Gaudí. They're like nothing you've ever seen before – colorful, wavy, and totally magical! Who knows, maybe you'll get to visit them later with your family?

So, even though you can't see much from the window, just imagine all the amazing things waiting for you above ground. Are you excited to explore Barcelona with your family?
