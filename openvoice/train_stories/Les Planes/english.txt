Wow, you're now at Les Planes station! Look out the window, and you'll see a mix of old and new buildings. You might spot some tall, modern houses and apartments, as well as some older, more historic ones.

Did you know that Les Planes used to be a tiny village surrounded by fields and farmland? It was a very small community, and people grew their own fruits and veggies here. Over time, as Barcelona grew, Les Planes became part of the city.

As you look out the window, try to spot the old, stone-built houses. Some of those houses date back to the 18th century! Imagine what it would be like to live in one of those old houses, surrounded by fields and animals.

Les Planes is also close to the beautiful Collserola Natural Park. You might not be able to see it from the train window, but it's just nearby. The park has tons of trails for hiking and biking, and you can even visit the iconic Tibidabo Amusement Park, which is one of the oldest in the world!

You know what's cool? Les Planes has a special train station because it's a key stop for people heading to the Collserola mountains or the Tibidabo Amusement Park. So, you're now a part of that adventure!
